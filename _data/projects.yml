- name: Genetic and molecular mechanisms of treatment resistance in DLBCL
  description: >
    Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent the sixth most commonly diagnosed
    type of cancer in Canada with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most prevalent.
    DLBCL patients exhibit variable responses to available therapies such
    as R-CHOP. Some biomarkers beginning to enter clinical trials rely on
    gene expression signatures to identify high-risk cases.
    For example, DLBCL comprises two cell-of-origin (COO) subgroups with
    activated B-cell (ABC) cases typically having worse prognosis than
    germinal centre B-cell (GCB) cases.
    Therapeutics that exploit molecular features unique to each subgroup
    are being actively pursued but up-front identification of patients
    unlikely to achieve a durable response remains a challenge.
    Although existing methods can identify specific prognostic gene
    expression features, these capture only some of the clinical
    heterogeneity and require tumour RNA, which is not always available.
    Using comprehensive genomic analyses and by integrating mutation and
    expression data from over 2000 DLBCL tumours, we seek novel molecular
    features that are associated with treatment resistance in DLBCL.
    The ultimate goal of this work is to develop new predictive and
    prognostic biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets for
    treatment-resistant DLBCLs.

- name: Resolving clonal structure and evolution patterns in DLBCL
  description: >
    Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma is a genetically heterogeneous form of cancer, 
    with different cells in the tumour acquiring different mutations. This 
    intra-tumour heterogeneity can have profound effects on treatment; if a clonal 
    subpopulations is resistant to treatment, it will reform the tumour following 
    treatment, causing the patient to relapse. We are recieving samples from several
    clinical trials exploring different salvage therapies for patients with relapsed
    DLBCL. Tumour biopsies and liquid biopsies are being collected from patients 
    both before and after they are treated. Using these temporal sources of tumour DNA,
    we can identify clonal subpopulations in the tumour, 
    and further explore how the tumour evolves and adapts in the face of a strong 
    selective pressure such as treatment. The mutations unique to these resistant 
    clonal subpopulations can be explored to determine which mutation(s) result 
    in treatment resistance. We can further determine if these mutations are 
    detectable prior to treatment, which may allow patient to be screened for resistance 
    mutations before they are treated.

- name: Circulating Tumour DNA as a biomarker in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  description: >
    This project aims to develop a novel way of monitoring patients with lymphoma and find a new immunotherapy regimen
    that would be effective in patients that are not cured with conventional chemotherapy. They will first genetically
    profile the tumours to determine at which time point they become resistant. They will then determine how these
    lymphomas evade immune detection and test if targeting these evasion strategies, i.e. "harnessing the immune response"
    is successful at eradicating chemo-resistant lymphoma.

- name: Comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
  description: >
    Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare cancer that derives from B lymphocytes in the periphery (mantle zone)
    of the germinal centre. MCL is most often diagnosed at stage 3 or 4 and is typically aggressive although some patients have an indolent form of the disesae.
    Only 30-40% of patients with advanced disease achieving a complete response to frontline treatments (R-bendamustine).
    Heterogeneous clinical response is partially attributable to observable variations in morphology, immunophenotype and proliferative capacity;
    however, there is little known about the relationship between genetic features and variation in phenotype or response to specific treatment regimens.
    Through a meta-analysis of in-house and existing exome sequencing data, our group has identified multiple novel driver mutations in MCL including some that associate with high or low proliferation.
    To more completely ascertain the mutations that lead to lymphomagenesis in MCL, we are performing an integrative proteogenomic characterization of MCL tumours using a combination of whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq and shotgun proteomics.
    We will are using these data to identify novel coding and non-coding (i.e. regulatory) driver mutations that affect the natural history of MCL including treatment response.

- name: Identification and functional characterization of recurrent non-coding mutations in NHLs
  description: >
       The list of protein-coding drivers identified through sequencing in DLBCL
       has begun to saturate and yet there remains a gap in our understanding
       of how these genetic alterations contribute to the
       transcriptional differences underlying known prognostic signatures and molecular subgroups.
       For example, dysregulation of NF-κB is the hallmark feature of ABC
       DLBCL but many ABC cases appear to lack the common driver mutations
       that are known to promote NF-κB. We are seeking driver mutations
       that contribute to some features of NHLs.
       We use data-driven comprehnsive methods that allow identification of
       non-coding SSMs with a regulatory effect in cis or trans on
       genes/proteins relevant to malignancy.

- name: Comprehensive characterization of endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma
  description: >
    Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is currently classified as one of three clinical
    variants: endemic BL, sporadic BL, and HIV-associated BL.
    The endemic variant is primarily diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa and is
    epidemiologically associated with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and
    malaria infection; although, the role of these pathogens in promoting
    the formation of BL remains unclear.
    On the other hand, sporadic BL is diagnosed outside of malaria-endemic
    areas, with only a minority of cases being EBV-positive (10-30%).
    This project seeks to generate high-throughput whole genome and
    transcriptome sequencing data from over 100 BL tumours in order to
    elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of the disease.
    With this project, we aim to refine the mutational landscape of BL to
    facilitate the development of less toxic targeted therapies.
    We also plan on investigating the oncogenic role of EBV and whether it may
    serve as a better criterion for disease classification than the current
    system relying on geographic origin.

- name: Genetic characterization of canine B-cell lymphomas
  description: >
    Cancer is the leading cause of premature death in pet dogs and non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the most common cancer in most dog breeds.
    Unlike human lymphomas with similar histopathology, canine B-cell lymphomas (cBCL) are incurable and exhibit an agressive clinical course.
    We are sequencing cBCLs to identify driver mutations that contribute to this cancer in a variety of dog breeds. 
    We identified TRAF3 as a novel tumour suppressor in cBCL and are pursuing additional candidate genes.
