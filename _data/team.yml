    I am in the department of <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/mbb.html">Molecular Biology and Biochemistry</a> at
    <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> and hold a Scientist appointment in the <a href="http://www.bcgsc.ca">BC Cancer Genome Sciences Centre</a>.
    I completed my MSc and PhD in bioinformatics at UBC in the laboratory of
    Marco Marra.
    My early research involved the use of massively parallel
    sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas
    including histone modifiers such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20081860">EZH2</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796119">KMT2D</a>.
    My current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome
    sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to
    determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment
    resistance.
    I have a general interest in developing methods to identify non-coding
    mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and
    error-corrected sequencing strategies and algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating
    tumour DNA (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874686">ctDNA</a>). Dr. Morin is a Scholar of the <a href="https://www.msfhr.org/">Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</a>.

    My main role at the Morin lab focuses on the development and
    implementation of assays with potential utility in the genetic
    stratification, non-invasive monitoring and management of cancer
    patients.
    We have developed assays relying on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874686">targeted hybridization capture
    followed by high throughput sequencing</a> as well as assays relying on
    droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).
    I am particularly interested in the development and optimization of
    molecular techinques for the ultrasensitive and straightforward
    detection of tumour-derived DNA fragments.
    Detection and quantification of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) via
    duplex sequencing with semi-degenerate barcoded adapters and the use
    of wild-type specific hydrolysis probes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440511">(“inverted” ddPCR)</a> to detect
    multiple recurrent somatic mutations of clinical relevance are
    amongst my main contributions into this growing area of research.
    Currently, I am involved in different projects related to the genetic
    characterization of different types of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the
    detection, quantification and serial monitoring of ctDNA in cancer
    patients, including those enrolled in the personalized oncogenomics
    project (POG). We are also starting to apply our error-correction
    duplex sequencing approach for the sequencing of ancient DNA,
    including archaeological specimens of both pacific salmons and
    woolly dogs.

    My current research goal is to identify genetic features that
    underlie elevated expression and somatic amplification of the FCGR2B
    gene as a driver of treatment resistance.
    Because Fc-gamma receptor IIB promotes the internalization of rituximab,
    a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of most non-Hodgkin
    lymphomas, patients with high FCGR2B expression experience inferior
    outcomes relative to patients with low FCGR2B expression.
    My project involves both wet and dry lab components, using analysis
    of RNAseq and whole genome and exome sequencing data to identify
    candidate drivers of FCGR2B expression, and functionally
    characterizing these candidates in cell lines.

    As the first bioinformatics graduate student in the lab, I've played
    a role in several projects, each involving cancer genomics to some
    degree.
    Currently, my primary project is the genetic and molecular
    characterization of paediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL).
    Defined by an epidemiological association with the Epstein–Barr virus
    and malaria, the endemic variant of BL has been understudied compared
    to sporadic BL, which is diagnosed in developed countries.
    I lead the analysis of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data
    derived from over 100 cases, which has led to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617194">breakthroughs</a> in our
    understanding of BL pathogenesis.
    On the side, I'm an advocate for open and reproducible science, a
    Software Carpentry instructor teaching programming to researchers,
    and the co-founder of the Scientific Programming Study Group at SFU
    (SciProg.ca) and the annual Hackseq genomics hackathon.

    My project in the lab is focused on the characterization of novel
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30275490">NFKBIZ 3’ UTR mutations</a> we previously discovered in DLBCL.
    These mutations were discovered through a project searching for
    genome-wide non-coding mutations and found to be significantly
    enriched in the ABC sub-type of DLBCL.
    My research involves functional analysis of these mutations in
    DLBCL cell lines and in vivo mouse xenograft models to determine
    how these mutations lead to activation of the NF-kB pathway and
    contribute to DLBCL.
    I am also working to determine the structure of the NFKBIZ 3’ UTR
    and how mutations lead to changes that affect the regulation of
    this gene.

    My research project focuses on identifying mutations in patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma; specifically,
    the analysis of liquid biopsies obtained from these patients. As cells undergo apoptosis, apoptotic bodies containing DNA
    are released into the bloodstream, and this DNA is called cell-free DNA. In patients with cancer, a portion of this
    cell-free DNA originates from malignant cells, termed circulating-tumour DNA. Thus, we can obtain tumour genetic material
    simply by obtaining a blood sample (called a liquid biopsy), which is less invasive and significantly cheaper than traditional
    biopsies. Due to the unique nature of liquid biopsies, I am currently developing several pieces of software for analyzing
    and benchmarking existing mutation-calling tools for use with these types of samples. I am applying these tools to samples
    collected from several clinical trials where liquid biopsies are collected after patients are treated. By comparing the
    mutation landscape of these patients prior to and following treatment, we identify mutations enriched following treatment,
    which may contribute to tumour treatment resistance.

    Recent studies have identified 4 or 5 genetic subgroups in DLBCL, which
    present a novel method of classification for alternative treatment
    strategies.
    My project aims to expand on classifying these subgroups
    in DLBCL using a machine learning approaches utilizing molecular indicators such as mutation status from a set
    of genes and hot spots, copy number status and cell-of-origin.
    I hope to consolidate subtypes from these studies as well as to
    capture novel groups to better describe clinical
    heterogeneity in DLBCL.
